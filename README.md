# IK-With-MuJoCo
This repository accompanies a hands-on robotics workshop on Inverse Kinematics with MuJoCo. It introduces forward and inverse kinematics and provides step-by-step implementations of Damped Least Squares IK, library-based IK using mink, and optimization-based IK formulated as a quadratic program, using the Franka manipulator as a running example.
